## CNN_Classification
The CNN model is based on the TensorFlow framework with brief exercise data.

### Reason for production
This artificial intelligence model was created to improve skills and gain experience in artificial intelligence development as a personal project.

### Dataset
Dataset was developed with simple practice data provided by "우경 정보 기술" I uploaded the current dataset to my github.
Accuracy and loss could not be guaranteed because the number of data per class was significantly small.
